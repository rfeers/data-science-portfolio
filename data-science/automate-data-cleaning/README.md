# Automate Data Cleaning with Python
This repository contains the corresponding code for the KDnuggets article [5 Simple Steps to Automate Data Cleaning with Python](https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-simple-steps-to-automate-data-cleaning-with-python). 
The project demonstrates how to automate the data cleaning process using Python, making data preprocessing more efficient and less time-consuming.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide and reusable code for automating the data cleaning process in Python. 
By following the steps outlined in the KDnuggets article, users can streamline their data preparation workflow and ensure their datasets are ready for analysis or modeling.

## Steps to Automate Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process is divided into five simple steps:

1. Handling Missing Values
* Identify and fill or remove missing values from the dataset.
* Use techniques like mean/mode/median imputation or forward/backward filling.

2. Handling Outliers
* Detect and treat outliers using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
* Apply techniques like z-score, IQR, or capping/flooring.

3. Handling Duplicates
* Identify and remove duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
  
4. Handling Inconsistent Data
* Standardize formats, correct typos, and unify categorical data representations.

5. Handling Incorrect Data Types
* Convert columns to appropriate data types for accurate analysis and modeling.
