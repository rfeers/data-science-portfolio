(FAISS, CHROMA, PINECONE...)\n- Once the vectors are persistend in the ddbb, we can get queries, embed them and find a similar chunk vectors. \n- The chunks are ranked according to how relevant they are to the question and are used to contextualize our LLM. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** The LLM doesn't really know what PDFs have. We take advantage of the LLM model to generate NLP answers and provide it with a question and a context to generate an accurate answer.

Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next. \n\n### **Why LangChain?**\n1. **Components** - Abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not\n\n2. **Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together. A structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks.\n\n3. **Speed 🚢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n\n4. **Community 👥** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n\nThough the usage of LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out), when trying to build complex applications you'll quickly notice friction points. \n\n> LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated application and manage LLMs the way we want.

Those are the so-called data chunks and the chunk size is highly determinant in the quality of the chatbot.\n\nThe tokenizer plays a crucial role in relation to data chunks when working with LLMs: \n- A **tokenizer is the tool used to convert text data into a format that can be processed by the model.**\n- Data is then stored in the vector stores in the tokenized format.\n\nTo convert the original data into tokens and split it in data chunks, we will use the **LangChain Text Splitter**.\n\nIf you are interested in more details about the tokenizer, the article [Unleashing the ChatGPT Tokenizer](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/chatgpt-tokenizer-chatgpt3-chatgpt4-artificial-intelligence-python-ai-27f78906ea54) is for you!\n","metadata":{},"id":"da29979d-f779-41e1-a35c-598770a03139","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"By using Langchain, we can highly customize how to split our data:\n- **Split by chunks**: The most general approach is to split your data into chunks of a concrete size. In the following example, we will take the data that we have already loaded (`wikipedia_data`, `hn_data` and `pdf_data`) and we will split it in portions of 200 characters. \n\n_What will happen if the split based on character count breaks a word?_\n\nThere is the concept of \"chunk overlap\" that refers to a method where consecutive chunks of text share some common content. This technique is used to maintain context and coherence when a long document is divided into smaller parts due to the token limitations of LLMs. In this case, we will use a chunk size of 20 characters.\n\nSo let's split the Wikipedia data we have just loaded: ","metadata":{},"id":"c72a417e-7708-4d1e-bc99-0b0ba703dbe1","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Splitter\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter \n# Tokenizer\nfrom transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast  \n\n# Advanced method - Split by chunks ________________________________________________________________________\n# Create function to count tokens\ntokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\n\ndef count_tokens(text: str) -> int:\n    return len(tokenizer.encode(text))\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\n    chunk_size      = 200, \n    chunk_overlap   = 20,\n    length_function = count_tokens # It uses len() by default. \n)\n\nprint(\"\\nSPLITTING BY CHUNKS\")\nwikipedia_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(wikipedia_data)\nprint(\"Wikipedia Data - Now you have {0} number of chunks.\".format(len(wikipedia_chunks)))","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":77,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":57,"type":"stream"},"2":{"height":77,"type":"stream"},"4":{"height":77,"type":"stream"},"5":{"height":57,"type":"stream"},"6":{"height":77,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"4df0ebc1-87a3-4755-a05d-4088db03b29d","cell_type":"code","execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"\nSPLITTING BY CHUNKS\nWikipedia Data - Now you have 78 number of chunks.\n"}]},{"source":"**TASK:**\n\nGenerate the chunks for both `HNLoader` and `PyPDFLoader`. \n1.

In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n\n vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), and many other areas (Oord et al., 2018; Jumper et al., 2021). Prior\nworks, such as CuBERT (Kanade et al., 2020), CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al.,\n2020), and CodeT5 (Wang et al., 2021), have applied transformers towards code understanding but\nthese mostly focus on code retrieval, classiﬁcation, and program repair. Several recent and concurrent\nefforts explore using large language models for program synthesis (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al.,\n2021; Li et al., 2022; Fried et al., 2022) and its effectiveness (Vaithilingam et al., 2022). While they\nfocus on generating code in a single turn, we propose to factorize the speciﬁcations into multiple turns\n\n The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n\n illia.polosukhin@gmail.com\nAbstract\nThe dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or\nconvolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\n"}]},{"source":"# PART 3: Talking with our documents","metadata":{},"id":"37afb3bf-6c25-4562-b9c7-f32d17729cf9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## STEP 4 - DEFINE A CHAIN AND PERFORM THE SIMILARITY SEARCH\nGenerating a simple pipeline to query our documents with a load_qa_chain. \n**TASK**\n1.
