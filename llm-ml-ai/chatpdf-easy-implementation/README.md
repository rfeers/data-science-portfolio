# ChatPDF Easy Implementation

This repository contains the code for implementing a simple ChatPDF application using Large Language Models (LLMs). The project demonstrates how to create a chat interface that allows users to interact with PDF documents through natural language queries.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to enable users to extract information and interact with PDF documents using a chat-based interface powered by LLMs. This application leverages the capabilities of modern AI models to understand and respond to user queries about the content of PDF files.

## Features
* __PDF Parsing:__ Extracts text and metadata from PDF documents.
* __Natural Language Processing:__ Understands and responds to user queries about the PDF content.
* __Chat Interface:__ Provides a simple chat interface for user interaction.
* __LLM Integration:__ Leverages Large Language Models for natural language understanding and response generation.
