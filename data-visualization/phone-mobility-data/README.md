# Tourism Mobility in Catalonia based on mobile phone data
This repository contains a data visualization project that models tourism data in Catalonia, Spain. The data was sourced from the [Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE)](https://www.ine.es/experimental/turismo_moviles/experimental_turismo_moviles.htm), merging data from "turismo receptor" and "turismo interno" to provide a comprehensive view of tourism in the Catalonia region.

## Overview

The project focuses on visualizing tourism data in Catalonia using PowerBI. The visualization offers insights into the volume and distribution of tourists, segmented by different origins and regions within Catalonia. 
The project features two main views: 
* Internal tourism segmented by the autonomous community of residence in Spain.
* Global view that includes both international tourists and domestic tourists (Catalans and people from the rest of Spain).

## Data Source

The data used in this project was obtained from the following website: [INE Tourism Mobility Data](https://www.ine.es/experimental/turismo_moviles/experimental_turismo_moviles.htm).

   - Data can be analyzed at the level of municipalities, comarcas, and touristic zones.

### Pyrenees Focus
A detailed analysis of the Pyrenees region, comparing different comarcas. This includes:
   - Concentration of arrivals by comarca.
   - Seasonality trends by comarca.
   - Dependence on international tourism by comarca.

## PowerBI Dashboard
The PowerBI dashboard visualizes the data with the following features:
   - Temporal evolution of tourist volumes from 2020 to 2023.
   - Monthly seasonality trends.
   - Tourist origins segmented by different regions and countries.
   - Geographic distribution of tourists within Catalonia.
